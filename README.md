#### Age: Age (years)
#### Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

Project Task:
1. Data Exploration:
Check the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Describe your findings and plan future course of action. Create scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Describe your findings. Perform correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.
